This is the source code of the MMDVM firmware that supports D-Star, DMR, and System Fusion.

Currently it only runs on the Arduino Due, but other platforms are planned.

In order to build this software you will need to edit a file within the Arduino GUI and that is detailed in the BUILD.txt file.

This software is licenced under the GPL v3 and is intended for amateur and educational use only. Use of this software for commercial purposes is strictly forbidden.

It is only to be used on the main DMR+, the main BrandMeister, and the Phoenix (UK) networks. If you wish to use it on any other network, you must get written permission from myself, G4KLX. Each such request will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.
